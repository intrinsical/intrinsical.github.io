Admiralty System Optimizer is an external third-party program for Star Trek Online that help pick the best set of ships to send out on Admiralty assignments.

**Note:** I have stopped playing Star Trek Online for several years. This is why ASO has not been updated. However, the complete source code for ASO is open sourced under the [GPL-3 license](https://github.com/intrinsical/sto-aso/blob/master/LICENSE).
